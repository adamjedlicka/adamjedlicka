My first experience with programming was at 7 years old when I was spicing up mine and my friends profile pages with HTML and CSS on Czech social network for kids - Alík.cz. Since then I learned some more HTML, CSS and even a bit of JS on Czech equivalent of W3Schools from two thousands - Jak psát web.

The real programming started in high school, where I learned C#, Java and C++. I completely fell in love with it and to this day it consumes the biggest part of my daily life.

One of my favourite subject are programming languages themselves. I've written non-trivial programs in at least a dozen of them and at least experimented with much more. My favourites are definitelly Go, PHP and JavaScript (I know...). My fascination with programming languages even got me to write language of my own - blu.

Even though in my professional career I do mostly frontend work in Vue.js, I still prefer backend because of its complexity, broader variety and my suckiness in design.

i use arch btw
